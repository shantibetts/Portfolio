# Portfolio Project

A mobile-first portfolio website utilizing Ajax to fetch data from Google Sheets to populate showcase projects and current skills. Jquery, native javascript and responsive CSS are used to create a seamless experience at any size. Ajax is used to fetch the background photo from unsplash, as well as the photo accredidation. A third Ajax call queries the weather in Yosemite Valley, where the background image was taken.
